  route_registrar.routes:
    description: |
      (required, array of objects): Routes that will be registered

      route object
        name (required, string): Human-readable reference for the route
        uris (required, array): URIs to which clients will make requests
        port (required, integer): Port to which requests for the URIs should be forwarded by the
          router. The IP is determined automatically from the host on which route-registrar is run.
        registration_interval (required, string): Interval between heartbeated route registrations
          (e.g. 10s). It must parse to a positive time duration i.e. "-5s" is not permitted.
        tags (optional, array of objects): Arbitrary key-value pairs emitted with metrics to support
          filtering of metrics
        health_check (optional, object): Script executed on frequency of `registration_interval`. If
          healthcheck script exits with success, route registration heartbeat is sent. If script exits
          with error, the route is unregistered.
        prepend_instance_index (optional, boolean): When set to true the values in `uris` will be
          prepended with the instance index. e.g. 'some-uri.system-domain.com' will become '0-some-uri.system-domain.com' on the instance with index 0, and '2-some-url.system-domain.com' on the instance with index 2. When this value is enabled, each instance will register its own, unique, set of uris. To additionally continue to register these original uris, create another route with the same uris and set 'prepend_instance_index' to false (or omit the key entirely).

      health_check object
        name (required, string): Human-readable reference for the healthcheck
        script_path (required, string): Path to script that will be run periodically to determine
          service health
        timeout (optional, string): The healthcheck script must exit within this timeout, otherwise
          the script is terminated with `SIGKILL` and the route is unregistered. Value is a string (e.g. "10s") and must parse to a positive time duration i.e. "-5s" is not permitted. Must be less than the value of `registration_interval`.
          Default: Half of the value of `registration_interval`

        uris:
          - my-service.system-domain.com

        port: 12345
        registration_interval: 20s

          script_path: /path/to/script
          timeout: 5s

        uris:
